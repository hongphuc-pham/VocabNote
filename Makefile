# ---------------------------------------------------------------- setting up

setup: ## Fetch packages and run every generator
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) pub get
	$(MAKE) gen l10n

gen: ## Run build_runner (riverpod, freezed, json, drift)
	# NOT --delete-conflicting-outputs: that flag was removed in build_runner 2.16.
	cd $(APP) && $(DART) run build_runner build

l10n: ## Regenerate lib/core/l10n/gen/ from app_en.arb
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) gen-l10n

# -------------------------------------------------------------------- checks

fmt: ## Format the code in place
	cd $(APP) && $(DART) format .

fmt-check: ## Fail if anything is unformatted (what CI runs)
	cd $(APP) && $(DART) format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .

analyze: ## Static analysis, warnings and infos fatal
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings

licences: ## Fail on any non-permissive dependency licence (RULES §15)
	cd $(APP) && $(DART) run tool/check_licences.dart

migration-safety: ## Fail on destructive migration patterns (RULES §7)
	cd $(APP) && $(DART) run tool/check_migration_safety.dart

# --------------------------------------------------------------------- tests

test: ## Run the suite (everything except the timed measurements and the pictures)
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) test --exclude-tags "perf || golden"

test-perf: ## The wall-clock budgets, alone - see app/dart_test.yaml
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) test --tags perf -j 1

test-golden: ## The pictures of the UI - compare only; see test/flutter_test_config.dart
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) test --tags golden

goldens-update: ## Redraw the pictures after a deliberate UI change, then commit them
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) test --tags golden --update-goldens

test-unit: ## Unit tests only — domain, application, data, core
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) test test/unit

test-widget: ## Widget tests only
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) test test/widget

test-migration: ## Migration tests — blocking, never skip (RULES §29)
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) test test/migration

test-arch: ## The layer-boundary and grapheme rules (RULES §20, §21)
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) test test/architecture

# ------------------------------------------------- measurements, on a device
#
# Not part of `ci`: these need an emulator or a phone, and CI has neither.
# They print figures rather than asserting budgets - a software-GPU emulator
# is not a phone, so a gate here would either be meaningless or flaky.
# The figures go in docs/PROGRESS.md §5 with the machine named beside them.
#
# `flutter test -d <device>` cannot do this: it has no --profile, and debug
# frame times are inflated by assertions past the point of meaning.

measure-scroll: ## Frame times scrolling 5,000 words (profile; needs a device)
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
	  --target=integration_test/words_scroll_perf_test.dart --profile

measure-startup: ## Cold-start breakdown (profile; writes app/build/start_up_info.json)
	cd $(APP) && $(FLUTTER) run --profile --trace-startup

# The full gate, in CI's exact order. Run this before pushing.
