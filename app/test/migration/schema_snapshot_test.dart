///
/// * the committed snapshot in `drift_schemas/` still matches the schema the
///   generated code produces - so a table changed without re-exporting fails
///   CI rather than shipping;
/// * a freshly created database passes drift's full schema validation;
/// * the harness itself compiles and runs, so the first real migration starts
///   from working infrastructure rather than a cold start.
///
/// `README.md` in this folder explains how to add the next one. The pipeline
/// these tests depend on was proven end to end at M1 with a throwaway
/// `words.synonyms` column, which was then reverted; v2 is the first real
/// migration to use it.
